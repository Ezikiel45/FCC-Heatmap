Create a heatmap of global land temperatures for freecodecamp

Using css, html and javascript (babel) create a responsive heatmap of global land temperatures. Using data provided by freecodecamp create a color coded graph of land temperatures by month over several years. A legend of the color scheme for quick reference. A hovering information box that opens at the cursor for more detailed information about the current month.
